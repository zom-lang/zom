Zom is a Ahead Of Time compiled programming language, the code generation and compilation is made with LLVM.  

## Goals

- **Ahead of Time** compiled programmaing language, that mean you will have great performance, because the transformation of the source code to assembly is done before. Contrary to Just In Time compilation who's occur at the same time as the execution.
- **Statically typed**, Zom solves types at compile time, and not at run time.
- **Performance**, because Zom is Ahead of Time compiled, all the hard work is done before the execution. And because Zom uses LLVM, a bunch of optimization is made at compile-time.
- **Safety and Simplicity**, Zom is safe and simple at the same time, because it doesn't have a very strict design.

## Usage

After [build](#build-zom) Zom, just run it and you will see that :
```
Usage: zom <COMMAND>

Commands:
  bobj        Builds a given file into an object file
  version     Get the current version of Zom
  get-target  Get the current target detected by LLVM
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

There are

- `bobj`, it's the contraction of `build an object`, this will transform the file passed in arguments and compiles it to an object file.
- `version`, that output the current version of Zom
- `get-target`, return the target found by LLVM.

## Build Zom

To build the source code of Zom, there are three steps :
1. Clone the repository / download the source code
2. Build with Cargo, in the root of the repository, `cargo build --all-targets --release`
3. The binary, now is in `./target/release/zom`, you can put it in your binary folder, use it like that etc...
## Source layout:
```
Cargo.toml               - Manifest for Cargo workspace
