about: A tracking issue for an accepted feature or RFC in Zom.
title: Tracking Issue for XXX
labels: C-tracking-issue

This is a tracking issue for the RFC "XXX" (zom-lang/rfcs#NNNN).

### About tracking issues

Tracking issues are used to record the overall progress of implementation.
They are also used as hubs connecting to other relevant issues, e.g., bugs or 
open design questions. A tracking issue is however *not* meant for large scale
discussion, questions, or bug reports about a feature. Instead, open a dedicated
issue for the specific matter and add the relevant feature gate label.

### Steps
<!--
Include each step required to complete the feature. Typically this is a PR
implementing a feature. However for larger features an implementation could
be broken up into multiple PRs.
-->

- [ ] Implement the RFC (cc @zom-lang/core-team -- can anyone write up mentoring
      instructions?)
- [ ] Adjust documentation.


### Unresolved Questions
<!--
Include any open questions that need to be answered before the feature can be
stabilised.
-->

XXX --- list all the "unresolved questions" found in the RFC to ensure they are
not forgotten

### Implementation history

<!--
Include a list of all the PRs that were involved in implementing the feature.
