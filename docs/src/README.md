# Introduction
**Zom is experimental and don't fully work yet.**

âš¡ Zom will be a safe system programming.

I will highly appreciate your contribution on the Zom Project !

## Feature / Goal

*This section is named "Feature / Goal" because some of the things listed
isn't actually implemented*

* **Safe**, using a system inspired by C++ *Resource Acquisition Is Initialization* and Rust *Ownership Based Ressource Management*.
* **Compile-time**, instead of macros, Zom uses `comptime`-things, and that also replace generic types.
* **Safe pointers, references**, inspired by Rust, Zom has references and a borrow checker.
* **Non-std dependant**, Zom has (will have) a standard library but it won't be imported by default.
* **Type as value**, Zom treat types as values so you define types kinda like global variables.
